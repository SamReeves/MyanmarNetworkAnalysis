    "# Project Description\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to find businesses (or ideally people) who are influential in drawing foreign and domestic investment in Myanmar.  Through basic network analysis techniques, we hope to find a clique of people or companies with common investment sources or common activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Description\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "This data was scraped and realeased anonymously from official government sources in two leaks called Myanmar Financials and Myanmar Investments.  The former is incorporation documents for ~125k companies, and the latter is information from investment proposals for about 10k companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Known Challenges\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "1. About 1/4 of the companies in Myanmar Financials paid somebody to approve their incorporation documents without addresses or names... We can do nothing about this.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. People in Myanmar are named for astrological information pertaining to their birth.  There is no family name, and many people have the same names.  We also cannot do anything about this.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A small number of names are given in Burmese script, which is included in UTF-8, but is unreadable to our team.  We can leave the script as-is, and remove punctuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Method\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import and clean the data\n",
    "2. Create an edge list:\n",
    "> |Company Name |People\n",
    "> --- | --- \n",
    "> |companyNameInMyanmar |officers, landOwner, nameOfInvestor\n",
    "3. Project bipartite graph, view statistics\n",
    "4. Trim edges, weighted by number of names per company\n",
    "5. Visualize"
